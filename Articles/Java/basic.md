# Basic knowladge of Java

-   **Interview question** Points of Object Language
    -   Abstract
        -   abstract class just make the function and variable but not use it.
    -   Encapsulation
        -   Put function and its variable together, only its function can visit its variable.
    -   Inheritance
        -   Extend parents function or variable make it can be developed efficient.
    -   Polymorphism
        -   some same Variable, function and something have different meaning.
-   Most Common Error of Java (todo)
    -   ClassCastException
    -   IllegalArgumentException
    -   NullPointerException
    -   IndexOutOfBoundsException
    -   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException+
-   Force Convert of Interface
    -   (Agg)a.getName();
-   Transient
    -   To aviod serialization method protect the function or variable, add transient on it
-   **Interview question** Visit type
    -   public -> This class, Same package, Child class, Other Package
    -   protected -> This class, Same package, Child class
    -   friendly -> This class, Same package
    -   private -> This class
-   Base class of every class
    -   java.lang.Object
-   JDK, JRE, JVM
    -   Dev kit, runtimg enviorment, and veritual machine.
-   **Interview question** Types of variable
    -   Local variable
        -   destroied after finish this function, only in the function
    -   instance variables
        -   in the class, but not in the function
    -   class variables
        -   Out of class, but add static
-   Different between sleep() and wait()
    -   sleep(1000)
        -   sleep 1 sec and wake up again
        -   extend from Thread class
    -   wait(1000)
        -   sleep max 1 sec and wake up or wake up at notify() or notifyAll() called
        -   extend from Object class
-   **Interview question** Does Java support multiple inheritance?
    -   No, but can be implement one and extent one.
-   How many class in one .java file
    -   Unlimited but only one public that have same name as the file name of .java file
-   **Interview question** Different between static function and normal one(The instance variables)
    -   instance
        -   use New object and call it function, called instance
    -   static
        -   No need to new anything, just use its function
-   Super
    -   Call the function from parent class use super
    -   Call the constructor of parnet use super()
        -   TO call parent's construtor, super() must at the first line of class constructor
        -   super() or super(parameter list)
-   **Interview question** Override and Overload
    -   Override
        -   to override the function, that recode a function from parent class
        -   Point of parent and child Polymorphism
    -   Overload
        -   Have mutiple function of same name in one class, with different constructor
    -   Can constructor can be override?
        -   It can be Overload but not Override
-   different in final, finally and finalize
    -   Final -> type a visit of function, variable or class
    -   Finally -> method run at last in a try catch function
    -   Finalize -> A way to collect garbage in GC
-   **Interview question** Interface and Abstract 
    -   Abstract class have constructor, but interface can't
    -   Abstract class have common variable, but interface can't
    -   Abstract class have non abstract function, but interface must be all abstract
    -   Abstract class have differnt visit type, but interface just can be abstract
    -   A class have make mutiple interface but only extend one abstract class
-   Int and Integer
    -   int is data type
    -   interger Encapsulation int class
-   Extend Exception class (todo)
-   How to serialization a file
    -   Serialization is a mechanism by which you can save the state of an object by converting it to a byte stream.
-   try and catch
    -   What will Java do when a return within try, and also annocend a finally
        -   Do the return, and do the finally
    -   Is every try must have a catch?
        -   no, but much have a finally instand of catch.
        -   Also a try can have both catch and finally 
-   Both in List, differnt between Arraylist and Vector
    -   Vector is Thread safe
    -   They both provide a start size of memeory, when the size keep growing, vector will increse the size of two times, in source code, arraylist is 1.5 time of size, but not in document
        -   Vector also provide the method to set incrase size every time
-   **Interview question** synchronized
    -   synchronize is thread safe
    -   for example if a function is not synchronized, it cannot be safed called in a same time of two threads
