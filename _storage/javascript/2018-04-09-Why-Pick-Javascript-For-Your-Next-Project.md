## Background

### History

Since 1992, commercial browsers have begun to penetrate the software market. With its advantages of no download, no updates, and fast response, commercial browsers have been active until today. The predecessor of Javascript was livescript, the scripting language of Netscape browser. The main use of livescript programming language at the time was form validation. At the beginning of the development of the browser, the validation of the forms was handled by the server, which caused every apparently erroneous input will cause network requests, which was fatal in the era of dial-up Internet access. The browser giants in 20 centra invariably launched a scripting language for developers to use, ScriptEase (c-minus-minus) from Nobas, JScript from Mircosoft IE, and livescript from Netscape.

After years of development, browser programs have gradually become the main medium for surfing the Internet. Implementing a complex website benefits from javascript becomes the only scripting language of browser. Ecma International (European Computer Manufacturers Association) established the first standard of ECMAScript in 1997, javaScript that we are now commonly used is the most widely used dialect of ECMAScript.

### NodeJS

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that can run JavaScript on the server side. (CITE!!)

## Discussion

### Advantage

The biggest advantage of NodeJS as a server language is its ability to handle IO-intensive applications. The so-called io-intensive program is a server-side program that focuses on database modification and deletion. Take Amazon.com as an example, when an user search for a keyword each time, the server needs to pull out all the products related to the searched keywords from the database. NodeJS is best at doing the job described above, thanks to the event listener model, excellent third-party ecosystem, and good performance, NodeJS is informing IO-intensive businesses.

### Event model

NodeJS receives, processes and returns requests using event registration system, event asynchronous processing system allows NodeJS to be unblocked by any IO and network latency.

### Ecosystem

NodeJS has the world's largest package management system - npm (nodejs package manager),
